<br> 
<h5>(a) Definitions</h5>

<p align="justify">We will begin by defining a few concepts about computers that will be 
frequently used throughout this course.</p>

<ul align="justify"; style="padding-left: 30px">
<li><b>The Central Processing Unit (CPU)</b> - also known as the processor, provides the 
instructions and processing power the computer needs to do its work. It executes instructions of 
a computer program, such as arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations. 
Within the CPU, we have cores and threads. They represent the CPU's processing capabilities and 
play a crucial role in its performance.
<ol style=“padding-left: 40px"><b>Cores:</b> Cores are individual processing units within a CPU. 
Each core is capable of executing instructions and performing calculations independently. A CPU 
with multiple cores can handle multiple tasks or threads simultaneously, which can lead to 
improved multitasking and overall performance. For example, a quad-core CPU has four cores, and 
an octa-core CPU has eight cores.</ol>
<ol style=“padding-left: 40px"><b>Threads:</b> Threads, in the context of a CPU, refer to virtual 
processing units. They are created by the CPU to handle specific tasks or processes. Each core 
can often support multiple threads, which allows the CPU to work on multiple tasks concurrently. 
This technology is known as multithreading. For instance, a CPU with hyper-threading technology 
might have two threads per core, effectively doubling the number of threads it can handle.</ol>

<p align=”justify”; style=“padding-left: 40px”><b><i>Note:</b>Having multiple cores and threads 
can 
significantly improve a CPU's performance, especially in scenarios where multiple tasks or 
applications are running simultaneously, such as in modern computing environments where 
multitasking is common. It enables smoother and more efficient processing of tasks, reducing 
bottlenecks and enhancing overall system responsiveness.</p></i>
</li>

<li><b>Random Access Memory (RAM) </b>  - it is your computer's short-term memory. This is where 
the data is stored that your computer processor needs to run your applications and open your 
files.</li>
<li><b>Hard disk drive (HDD) </b> - HDD Is a data storage device used in computers to store and 
retrieve digital information. It is a non-volatile storage medium, meaning it retains data even 
when the power is turned off. HDDs have been a common form of secondary storage for many years, 
although they are gradually being replaced by Solid-State Drives (SSDs) in many applications due 
to the latter's faster speed and other advantages.</li>
<li><b>Solid-state drive (SSD) space </b> - SSD is a storage device that uses fast and durable 
memory chips to store data in electronic form. It provides storage space for your files, 
applications, and operating system in your computer or device, serving as a modern and speedy 
alternative to traditional HDDs</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p align="center"><img width="600" height="240" alt="logo"
src="assets/images/logo/comp_1.png"></p>

<br>

<p align=”justify”>To successfully complete this course, you will need ~100GB HDD/SSD free space 
in a single partition/drive and atleast 8GB of RAM, to store input data (i.e., raw reads [fastq 
files]and databases [kraken - 8GB; serotyping databases (seroba_k71_14082017 & GBS-SBG); and 
popPUNK database - 21GB), and output data.</p>

<p align=”justify”>Outside this course, the choice of computing platform can be selected based on 
amount of data generated per year. For example, if generating:</p>

<ul align="justify"; style="padding-left: 30px">

<li><100 raw reads in a year, you can use a laptop/personal computer to analyse your data.</li>

<li>between 100 - 1000 reads, you might  need a workstation which is a high-performance computer 
system that is basically designed for a single user and has advanced graphic capabilities, large 
storage capacity, and a powerful central processing unit. A workstation is more capable than a 
personal computer(PC)/laptop but is less advanced than a server.</li>

<li>>1000 raw reads in a year, you will need server/cluster - a server is a specialised computer 
or software system designed to provide services, resources (especially CPU and RAM), or data to 
other computers or devices, known as clients, over a network. Clusters are groups of servers that 
are managed together and participate in workload management.</li>
</ul>

<p align="center"><img width="600" height="340" alt="logo"
src="assets/images/logo/comp_2.png"></p>

<h5>(b) Operating systems</h5>

<p align="justify">An operating system (OS) is a fundamental software component that 
manages and controls a computer's hardware resources and provides a foundation for 
running applications. It serves as an intermediary between the hardware and 
software, allowing users and applications to interact with and utilize the 
computer's resources effectively.</p>

<p align="justify">Unix, Linux, and Windows are three different families of 
OS used on computers and servers. Here are some key differences 
between them:

<ul align=”justify”; style="padding-left: 30px">
<li><b>Unix</b>: is one of the earliest operating systems, developed at AT&T's Bell 
Labs in the late 1960s. It has a rich history and served as the inspiration for many 
other operating systems. Unix operating systems are often proprietary and require 
licenses. Different flavors of Unix (e.g., AIX, HP-UX, Solaris) have different 
owners and licensing terms.</li>

<li><b>Linux</b>: is a Unix-like operating system that was developed in the 
early 1990s by Linus Torvalds. It is based on Unix principles and design but is 
open-source and community-driven. Linux is open-source and distributed under various 
licenses, such as the GNU General Public License (GPL). This means it is generally 
free to use, modify, and distribute. Types of Linux distributions include: 
Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora etc.</li>

<li><b>Windows</b>: is developed by Microsoft and has its roots in MS-DOS, 
which was released in the 1980s. Windows has a distinct development history from 
Unix-based systems.Windows is proprietary software, and users need to purchase 
licenses for its use. Microsoft offers different editions with varying features and 
licensing models.</li>

</ul> </p>

<p align="justify"; style="padding-left: 30px"><i><b>Note</b></i></p>
<p align="justify"; style="padding-left: 30px"><i>Both Unix and Linux provide 
text-based and graphical user interfaces. Users can choose to work in a 
command-line environment or use graphical desktop environments. While Unix and Linux 
have graphical interfaces, they are known for their powerful command-line 
interfaces. Many tasks and system administration can be performed more efficiently 
through the command line. These operating systems use a hierarchical file system 
with directories and files. File paths are case-sensitive.

<br>
<br>

Windows is primarily known for its graphical user interface (GUI), with versions 
like Windows 10 and 11 offering a modern, user-friendly desktop interface. Windows 
has a strong emphasis on GUI-based interaction, and many users may not need to use 
the command line for day-to-day tasks. </i></p>

<p align="justify"; style="padding-left: 30px"><i><b>If you are a Windows user, we 
recommend that you install Linux OS given that it has powerful command-line 
interfaces. </b></i></p>

<p align="justify"; style="padding-left:70px"><i><b>How to install Ubuntu in Windows 
computer</i></b>

<p align="justify"; style="padding-left:70px"><i>To install Ubuntu on a 
Windows computer, you can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), which 
allows you to run a Linux distribution alongside your existing Windows 
installation without the need for dual-booting. Here are the steps to 
install Ubuntu using WSL:</i></p>

<p align="justify"; style="padding-left:70px"><i><b>a. Prerequisites:</i></b></p>

<p align="justify"; style="padding-left:70px"><i>1. Windows 10 or later: Ensure 
that you are running Windows 10 or a later version.</i></p>

<p align="justify"; style="padding-left:70px"><i>2. Enable WSL: Open PowerShell 
as Administrator and run the following command to enable WSL:<br> <code><b>dism.exe 
/online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all 
/norestart</code></b></i></p>

<p align="justify"; style="padding-left:70px"><i>3. Enable Virtualization: 
If you're using a virtual machine, ensure that virtualization is enabled in 
your BIOS/UEFI settings. You can check if virtualisation is enabled on your 
task manager as shown in the image below</i></p>

<p align="center"><img width="400" height="300" alt="logo"
src="assets/images/logo/comp_5.png"></p>

<p align="justify"; style="padding-left:70px"><i><b>b. Install Ubuntu 
using CLI:</i></b></p>

<p align="justify"; style="padding-left:70px"><i>1. Open PowerShell: Open 
PowerShell as Administrator.</i></p>

<p align="justify"; style="padding-left:70px"><i>2. Download Ubuntu Image: 
Download the Ubuntu image (choose the version you want) using the curl 
command: <br><code><b>curl.exe -o ubuntu-20.04.appx https://aka.ms/wslubuntu2004
</code></b> <br> Replace 
20.04 with the desired version. </i></p>

<p align="justify"; style="padding-left:70px"><i>3. Install Ubuntu: 
Install Ubuntu using the Add-AppxPackage PowerShell cmdlet: 
<br><code><b>Add-AppxPackage

you to set up a new user account with a 
username and password.</i></p>

<p align="justify"; style="padding-left:70px"><i><b>c. Update and 
Upgrade.</b> After setting up Ubuntu, it's a good idea to update the package 
lists and upgrade the installed packages to ensure you have the latest 
software versions. Open the Ubuntu terminal and run the following 
commands: <br>
<code><b>sudo apt update</code></b>
<br>
<code><b>sudo apt upgrade</code></b>
